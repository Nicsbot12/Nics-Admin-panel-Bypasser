# Try common vulnerabilities like weak passwords, outdated versions, and plugins with known vulnerabilities

# Step 2: Exploit vulnerabilities

# Perform additional testing based on the identified vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
# This may include more in-depth testing, exploitation, and analysis
